This is the source code for my game CHESSsansGPT, which you can find on itch.io at
https://mrcandela.itch.io/chesssansgpt

This was a really fun project to work on as part of the University of Auckland game Development Guild's Game Jam for Semester 1 2023. This game was an intermediate step to producing the full game, ChessGPT, which added an unpredictable AI and can be found at https://mrcandela.itch.io/chessgpt

I programmed this game before I had learnt about classes and every cool feature they had, and looking back I'm surprised it even worked at all. Over the 2023/2024 summer break, I found the time to come back and tidy the code up, and I'm very surprised at how well that turned out.

Have a browse, have a look, and see what you think! And give ChessGPT a look as well :)
